          <h2>We Are Liberty For Iran</h2>
          For this project, I was part of a group working for an activist raising awareness about the Mahsa Amini protests in Iran. The activist had created her own way of helping the cause - by creating an informative presence on social media as well as merchandise with artwork that would help raise the awareness further. However, as the initial presence for the was limited, we decided to create a concept as well as a real prototype for a website. 
          <br>
          We designed website so it would encapsulate all of WALFI's ways of working - including some informative pages as well as an online store / donation page. In addition, we also created content that we would feature on the website itself as well as adjust for use on different social media channels.

          <h2>Stardust Lab</h2>
          In this assignment, I had to work with a brand specializing in producing sports bikinis for bodybuilding practices. 
          <br>
          After consulting with the client, ideas for creating a new brand image and online identity were discussed. 
          <br>
          As a solution, we had to come up with a design concept that would connect with the niche audience as well as a prototype for a structured web solution that would line up with the client's need. This included design and structure for an online store where a customer could choose their product, customize it to their wants and needs with different tools provided within the store itself as well as a logotype that the client could use not only on the website but also their social media channels and the branding on the products.

          <h2>Copenhagen Cartel</h2>
          For this assignment, I had to work together with my group to create a solution that would include various formats of SoMe content as well as a concept for a brand campaign. This time the client provided detailed instructions and guidelines which we had to include in our development process.
          <br>
          Here we also had to focus more on creating original content - our own idea for a product campaign that would correlate with the brand's image and message, as well as video content that could be used in various types of media - the website itself as well as different SoMe platforms where the brand is present.
